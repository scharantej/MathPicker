## Flask Application Design:

### 1. HTML Files:

**a. index.html:**
- Serves as the landing page of the application.
- Includes a form with various elements:
  - Radio buttons for selecting mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
  - Text fields for entering the range of numbers (minimum and maximum).
  - Labels and explanatory text to guide the student.
  - A submit button that triggers the challenge generation.

**b. challenge.html:**
- Displays the generated challenge for the student.
- Displays a set of numbers within the specified range.
- Includes a form to input the selected mathematical operations and their solutions for each number.
- Submit button to validate the answers and provide feedback.

### 2. Routes:

**a. @app.route('/') (GET):**
- Handles requests to the landing page (index.html).

**b. @app.route('/challenge', methods=['GET', 'POST']):**
- Handles requests for generating the challenge and processing the student's answers.

**GET:**
  - Generates a random set of numbers within the specified range.
  - Renders the 'challenge.html' template with the generated numbers and form for solution input.

**POST:**
  - Receives the student's answers from the form.
  - Validates the answers and generates feedback (correct or incorrect).
  - Renders the 'challenge.html' template with the feedback and the student's answers.

### 3. Additional Notes:

- The application can be extended to include a login system for students, allowing them to track their progress and performance over time.
- To enhance the challenge, the application can generate more complex expressions involving multiple mathematical operations and parentheses.
- The application can incorporate a timer to encourage quick and accurate responses from the students.
